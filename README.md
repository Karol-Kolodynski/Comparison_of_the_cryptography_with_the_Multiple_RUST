# 🦀 CryptoThreads-Rust

A testing platform written in **Rust** to analyse the performance of cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA) and multithreaded text processing. The project allows testing and comparison of execution time, CPU and RAM consumption.

---

## 📘 Project description

The main objectives of the project are:

- Performance evaluation of encryption and decryption algorithms (AES, RSA),
- Testing multi-threaded operations on large text files,
- Measuring resource consumption of operations (time, CPU, RAM),
- Testing the capabilities of the Rust language for cryptography and multithreading.

## 🔍 Functionality

## 🛡 Cryptographic mode:
- Encryption and decryption of data (AES, RSA),
- Possibility to use your own data or generate random data,
- Configuration: number of passwords, text length, key length.

### 🔄 Multi-threaded text processing mode:
- Searching large text files in multiple threads,
- Selection of number of threads, keywords, source file,
- Return of results and performance measurement.

### 📊 Performance measurement:
- Processing time,
- CPU consumption,
- RAM consumption.
